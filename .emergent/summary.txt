The AI engineer successfully transitioned the RUBIO GARCÍA DENTAL SaaS from MVP to a feature-rich platform. Initial work involved core modules (Agenda, Comunicaciones, Recordatorios, Plantillas),  for Google Sheet imports, and robust admin authentication. A significant expansion followed with a Configuración (Settings) section, integrating AI capabilities, a voice assistant, smart automations, and a color-coded urgency system. The application was converted to a PWA with an iPhone-optimized voice assistant widget.

A major recent effort focused on replacing Make.com in the Gesden-Google Sheets integration. The AI engineer modified the local Python script () to directly update both Google Sheets (replicating Make.com's new/modified row logic) and the SaaS application. This involved extensive debugging for Google Service Account permissions and Dockerfile deployment issues on Railway (eventually pivoting to a local GABINETE2 solution for Make.com removal).

Subsequently, the focus shifted to enhancing patient communication. The AI engineered a system for automated WhatsApp responses to confirm/cancel appointments, updating statuses in Google Sheets and Gesden (via a Flask API). This evolved to include smart rescheduling preferences (morning/afternoon) and displaying these as prioritized tasks on the dashboard with color codes. The latest discussion involves implementing interactive WhatsApp buttons for consent forms (treatment-specific, LOPD) and a first-visit survey, with automated tracking and staff notification. The trajectory concludes with the AI presenting a detailed plan for this interactive consent system.

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application's high-level architecture consists of a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, a Node.js WhatsApp service, and integrations with Google Sheets, an external Gesden SQL database, and AI capabilities.



-   : The core FastAPI backend application. It has been significantly expanded to include AI voice assistant endpoints, automation logic, Google Sheets write endpoints, WhatsApp integration, and new endpoints for Gesden integration (e.g., ). It now defines constants for mapping treatment, doctor, and status codes, and includes the logic for managing consent templates and processing Gesden appointment data.
-   : The main React component for the frontend. It integrates various UI components like , , , , and the newly added  component. It also handles navigation and PWA service worker registration.
-   : Lists Python dependencies for the backend. It was updated to include necessary libraries for Google Sheets API, emergentintegrations (LLM/WhatsApp), FastAPI, and other core components.
-   : A newly created React component responsible for displaying the Gesden management interface within the application. This includes tabs for status, Gesden appointments, consents, and templates.
-   : The Node.js service dedicated to WhatsApp integration. It uses the  library to manage WhatsApp connection (via QR code), receive incoming messages, and send messages.
-   : A new standalone Python script designed to run locally on the Gesden server (). It replaces the previous Make.com workflow by connecting to the Gesden SQL database, extracting appointment data, and then directly sending this data to both Google Sheets (performing append/update logic based on  vs ) and the SaaS application's API. This script also contains mappings for doctors, treatments, and status IDs.
-   : Stores the Google Service Account credentials, essential for  to authenticate and write directly to Google Sheets without user intervention.
-   : A specific  file for , listing Python dependencies such as  for SQL Server connection,  for Google Sheets API, and  for HTTP calls to the SaaS app.
-   : Used for cloud deployment (e.g., Railway). It defines the build environment, installs Python dependencies (including  from a private index), copies application code, and specifies the startup command for the FastAPI server.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement interactive WhatsApp buttons for consent forms (He leído y doy mi consentimiento, Prefiero que me lo expliquen de nuevo), including attaching PDF documents for treatment consents and LOPD.
-   Develop the first-visit survey flow via WhatsApp, including questions and a button for LOPD acceptance.
-   Integrate WhatsApp response processing to update appointment statuses (Confirmada/Cancelada) in Google Sheets and Gesden, and manage the rescheduling process by creating prioritized dashboard tasks.
-   Finalize the deployment of the SaaS application to a cloud environment (Railway deployment was started but encountered issues and was deferred).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully migrated the user's Gesden data synchronization from a Make.com-dependent workflow to a direct integration. This involved:
1.  **Make.com Elimination**: A new  script was developed and extensively tested. This script runs on the local Gesden server (GABINETE2), extracts appointment data from the SQL database, and then directly sends this data to both Google Sheets and the SaaS application's Gesden API endpoint. Crucially, the script now accurately replicates Make.com's logic for distinguishing between new and modified appointments (using  and  timestamps) to either append new rows or update existing ones in Google Sheets, preventing data duplication.
2.  **Google Sheets Direct Write**: Configured and successfully tested direct write access to Google Sheets using a Google Service Account (), ensuring proper authentication and permissions for the  script.
3.  **Local Deployment Ready**: The  script, along with its specific  and the , is prepared for deployment on the GABINETE2 machine, with successful test runs demonstrating complete data synchronization to Google Sheets. The SaaS app integration part in the script is temporarily disabled as the app is not yet deployed.

Following this, the user clarified a critical need for **bidirectional communication for appointment status updates** (confirmations/cancellations) via WhatsApp. The AI engineer proposed a simplified, effective plan:
-   The system will process WhatsApp responses (Confirmo, Cancelo).
-   It will update the appointment status in Google Sheets and Gesden (via the local ).
-   For cancellations, it will ask the patient if they prefer to BUSCAR CITA (leading to a yellow dashboard task for staff follow-up, indicating a reschedule request) or CONTACTAR DESPUÉS.
The latest user request further enhanced this, asking for **interactive WhatsApp consent forms**. The AI engineer has just presented a detailed technical proposal for implementing this:
-   Generating messages with interactive buttons (He leído y doy mi consentimiento, Prefiero que me lo expliquen).
-   Attaching PDF documents for treatment-specific consents and LOPD.
-   For first appointments, initiating a structured survey and providing an LOPD document with an acceptance button.
-   Tracking consent/survey status and creating corresponding prioritized tasks on the dashboard.
