The previous AI engineer successfully expanded the RUBIO GARCÍA DENTAL SaaS application, initially an MVP. Key development included: replacing  with  for scheduled Google Sheet imports; creating a dynamic Agenda section displaying appointments with a monthly calendar, date filtering, and 5-minute refresh; resolving Google Sheets API key issues and ensuring accurate data import (2,293 appointments, 752 unique patients) using specific column mappings.

Subsequently, a Comunicaciones module was built, featuring a 3-panel chat interface with AI toggle, patient history, and bulk reminder capabilities. This was then refactored into a dedicated Recordatorios tab with granular selection, template dropdown, CSV import, and sent status. A Plantillas section for CRUD operations on message templates was added, integrated with Recordatorios. Finally, a robust administrator authentication system (user: JMD, pass: 190582) was implemented, protecting the entire application, and a Configuración tab with AI capabilities was initiated.

<product_requirements>
The user requested an omnichannel SaaS application, RUBIO GARCÍA DENTAL, for managing dental clinic operations. Key modules include Chat & Communication, Broadcast & Marketing, Agenda & Appointments, Reminders, Templates, Configuration, and Account. The UX/UI must be modern, responsive, and intuitive.

Specific feature requests addressed during development:
1.  **Google Sheets Integration:** Import appointment data from a provided Google Sheet (), update every 5 minutes, using Fecha as the key. Prevent patient duplication.
2.  **Agenda Module:** A new menu option Agenda to display imported appointments in a list format, selectable by a monthly calendar, with future editability and selection for confirmation messages.
3.  **Communications Module:** A free-form communication interface with AI chatbot functionality (toggleable), bulk appointment reminders using templates, and a patient summary with recent appointments and treatment history.
4.  **Reminders Module:** A dedicated Recordatorios tab with date-specific appointment loading, individual/bulk selection, template dropdown, sent status, and CSV import for annual/revision reminders.
5.  **Templates Module:** A Plantillas tab for creating, modifying, and deleting message templates, with a name for each and visible automatic edit fields (variables).
6.  **Admin Authentication:** Implement a login system with username JMD and password 190582 to secure the application.
7.  **Settings Module:** Add a Configuración option to implement future modifications, specifically including AI capabilities.

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement the detailed AI capabilities within the newly created Configuración (Settings) component, beyond just the basic UI structure.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing a new Configuración (Settings) section for the application. The user requested this section for future updates and fixes, specifically asking to Dale capacidades de IA (give it AI capabilities).

The AI engineer's last action was to create the frontend component for these settings and integrate it into the main application's navigation and rendering logic. Specifically:
1.  A new  component was created. This component likely includes placeholder UI for various AI-related configurations (e.g., AI model management, advanced settings).
2.  The  function in  was updated to display this  component when the corresponding navigation item is selected.

The current state is that the Configuración tab is present in the UI and navigable, but the specific AI capabilities requested by the user are not yet implemented. The component is a structural placeholder awaiting the actual integration and configuration options for AI functionalities.
