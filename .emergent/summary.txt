The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the RUBIO GARCÍA DENTAL application from an MVP, integrating complex features like an interactive WhatsApp system, AI automations, and a robust user management system. The trajectory highlights an iterative development process driven by detailed user feedback. Key achievements include replacing Make.com with local Python scripts for Gesden sync, dynamic PDF generation, and implementing a daily qualitative WhatsApp summary.

However, a recurring theme was the disconnect between automated testing success and actual user experience, leading to critical bugs in UI rendering (e.g., calendar not showing data, navigation issues) and core functionality (WhatsApp message sending, access management saving). The AI demonstrated a systematic approach to debugging frontend-backend interactions and UI components, often revising previous fixes based on user screenshots. The most recent focus was on a critical dashboard bug and unifying WhatsApp interfaces, showcasing continuous refinement based on direct user reports.

<product_requirements>
The RUBIO GARCÍA DENTAL application is an omnichannel SaaS for dental clinic management, aiming to streamline operations and enhance patient engagement.
Key requirements include:
1.  **AI Integration**: Voice assistant, patient triage, urgency system for conversations, customizable automation rules with AI prompts.
2.  **PWA/Mobile Widget**: For quick AI access.
3.  **Data Synchronization**: Bidirectional Google Sheets sync (application -> Sheets, Gesden -> Sheets), direct Gesden agenda data import to SaaS.
4.  **WhatsApp Communication**: AI-driven, automated reminders, interactive consent forms (treatment-specific, LOPD), appointment confirmations/cancellations, qualitative daily summaries.
5.  **Consent Management**: Automated delivery, interactive patient responses, dashboard tracking.
6.  **Automated File Synchronization**: Updates critical files on local Gesden server ().
7.  **User Management**: Role-based permissions (, , , declare -r BASHOPTS="checkwinsize:cmdhist:complete_fullquote:extquote:force_fignore:globasciiranges:globskipdots:hostcomplete:interactive_comments:patsub_replacement:progcomp:promptvars:sourcepath"
declare -ar BASH_VERSINFO=([0]="5" [1]="2" [2]="15" [3]="1" [4]="release" [5]="aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu")
declare -ir EUID="0"
declare -ir PPID="18"
declare -r SHELLOPTS="braceexpand:hashall:interactive-comments"
declare -ir UID="0") with passwordless login for specific roles.
8.  **Dashboard Enhancements**: Display pending messages/urgencies with summaries, calendar view with daily appointments and default current day, pie charts for message statistics (e.g., % confirmed, avg response time).
9.  **WhatsApp/Communications UI**: Unified interface mirroring a WhatsApp Business-style layout, ability to open conversations by searching patients or entering unsaved numbers, functional refresh buttons, persistent WhatsApp session.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and a Node.js WhatsApp service, integrating with Google Sheets, a local Gesden SQL database, and AI.



-   : Core FastAPI backend. Expanded with endpoints for AI voice assistant, automation logic, Google Sheets, WhatsApp, Gesden. Recent additions include interactive WhatsApp responses, consent template CRUD, AI automation rules, daily WhatsApp summaries, file sync endpoints, and user authentication/authorization with role-based permissions. New endpoints for conversations were added, including fetching patient history.
-   : Main React component. Integrates new UI components and navigation (, , , ). Heavily modified for Dashboard calendar (alignment, default date, appointment rendering),  (visibility of select-all, API scope),  (API URL fix), and  navigation logic (fixing duplication, z-index, and clickability issues). The  tab was removed and  was updated to render .
-   : Node.js WhatsApp service. Modified to handle incoming interactive button responses and route to backend. Configured for QR code generation and message sending. Added to Supervisor for continuous running.
-   : New React component for managing users, roles, and permissions. Integrated into .
-   : New React component created during the trajectory to unify and replace the UI of  and , providing a WhatsApp Business-style interface with conversation lists, chat area, and new conversation functionality.
-   : New configuration file to run  under Supervisor.
-   : Updated to correctly use the  variable.
-   : Modified to include microphone testing functionality.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Update the  script on the GABINETE2 server to integrate with the new backend functionalities.
-   Implement the Google Sheets -> SaaS data flow to achieve full bidirectionality.
-   Implement SaaS -> Gesden data flow to reflect application changes in the local Gesden database.
-   Ensure WhatsApp session persists across multiple devices for the same user.
-   Fix saving changes in the user access management section.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a critical bug reported by the user: the dashboard calendar was *not displaying today's appointments* despite the statistics cards correctly showing 12 citas hoy. This indicates a persistent issue with the frontend's ability to fetch and/or render appointment data correctly in the dashboard's calendar view. The last action taken was an  command targeting , specifically focusing on the  component's rendering logic related to appointments (Chat Message 444). The AI acknowledged the severity of this unacceptable bug and was in the process of debugging and fixing it. The issue stems from the data being available on the backend, but failing to display correctly on the frontend, previously attributed to scoping, rendering, or timing issues within React components.
