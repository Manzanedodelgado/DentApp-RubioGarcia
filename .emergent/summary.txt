The previous AI engineer successfully initiated and built an omnichannel SaaS application, OmniDesk, later rebranded to RUBIO GARCÍA DENTAL, from scratch. The initial phase focused on establishing a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database, ensuring adherence to strict environment and URL rules. Core MVP features, including basic UI and CRUD operations for contacts/messages, were implemented and tested.

Subsequent development cycles addressed key user requests: integrating an AI for WhatsApp responses with a training module using Emergent LLM key, making the application fully responsive, and incorporating user-provided branding assets. The AI functionality was thoroughly tested and an API fix was applied. The latest work revolves around integrating appointment data from a Google Sheet, with a requirement for a 5-minute synchronization. The engineer created an  script but encountered an error installing  for scheduling, leaving the display of imported appointments as the immediate pending task.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a comprehensive SaaS application, similar to Kokuai, focusing on omnichannel communication, appointment management, automation, and marketing for businesses (e.g., dental clinics).

Key modules include:
1.  **Chat & Communication:** Unified inbox for various channels (WhatsApp, email, SMS, Facebook Messenger, IG), contact/agent management, group organization, and conversation analytics.
2.  **Broadcast & Marketing:** Mass campaign sending across channels, segmentation, and detailed reports.
3.  **Agenda & Appointments:** Integrated calendar, online booking with auto-confirmations, reminders, and easy re-scheduling/cancellations.
4.  **Recordatorios y Recalls:** Automated messages for appointments, payments, and renewals, plus programmed recalls for inactive clients.
5.  **Plantillas y Automatismos:** Library of customizable message templates and automated workflows.
6.  **Configuración e Integraciones:** Integration with CRMs, Google Calendar, Outlook, medical/ERP systems, and a multi-user admin panel.
7.  **Cuenta y Soporte:** Billing information, support access, and help center.

The UX/UI must be modern, intuitive, configurable, and minimize friction, featuring a dashboard-style sidebar and state graphs.

Specific requests during development included:
*   Rebranding to RUBIO GARCÍA DENTAL using provided images.
*   Integrating an AI to answer WhatsApp messages, including a training space for behavior customization.
*   Ensuring the application is fully responsive for desktop and mobile.
*   Using a specific Logo blanco.jpeg as a vignette.
*   Integrating appointment data from a Google Sheet (), with automatic updates every 5 minutes.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on integrating appointment data from a Google Sheet provided by the user. An  script was created in the  directory, designed to handle the fetching and parsing of data from the Google Sheet. The user explicitly requested that this data synchronization occur every 5 minutes.

To achieve this, the AI engineer attempted to install  via , but this command failed with the error ERROR: No matching distribution found for asyncio-cron. This issue prevented the immediate implementation of the scheduled sync.

Following this dependency error, the user inquired, Cómo puedo ver las citas cargadas de Google drive?. The AI engineer responded that the next steps would involve successfully loading the real appointment data and then updating the frontend interface to correctly display these appointments. Therefore, the current work is in a state where the backend script for importing data exists, but the scheduling mechanism is blocked by a dependency error, and the frontend display for this new data is yet to be implemented.
