The previous AI engineer successfully brought the RUBIO GARCÍA DENTAL SaaS application from an MVP to a feature-rich platform. Initial work included replacing  with  for Google Sheet imports, and developing core modules: Agenda (appointments, calendar), Comunicaciones (chat, patient history, reminders), Recordatorios (dedicated tab for reminders, templates, CSV import), Plantillas (template CRUD), and robust administrator authentication.

The trajectory then details a significant expansion. The AI engineer implemented a Configuración (Settings) section with comprehensive AI capabilities, including a voice assistant, smart automations (reminders, consents), and a color-coded urgency system for patient conversations. This involved extensive backend updates (FastAPI, emergentintegrations) and a new frontend  component.

Subsequently, the application was converted into a Progressive Web App (PWA) with an iPhone-optimized voice assistant widget for quick access. A critical bidirectional synchronization feature with Google Sheets was implemented, requiring a Google Service Account for write permissions, allowing changes in the app to reflect in the sheet and vice versa.

Finally, a full WhatsApp Business integration was achieved, combining the existing AI assistant for automated patient communication (probing, urgency detection, specialist referral) and intelligent automations. The last interaction involved the user detailing an external workflow with a local Gesden agenda, a Python script, and Make.com, which the AI engineer meticulously analyzed, setting the stage for integrating this external system.

<product_requirements>
The RUBIO GARCÍA DENTAL application aims to be an omnichannel SaaS for dental clinic management. Initial requirements included Google Sheets integration for appointment import (5-min sync, no patient duplication), an Agenda module with calendar and list views for appointments, a Comunicaciones module with an AI chatbot and bulk reminders, a Recordatorios tab for managing reminders and templates, a Plantillas section for message templates, and an admin login (/).

Recent user requests expanded these capabilities significantly:
1.  **AI Capabilities in Settings**: Implement an AI assistant with voice interaction for commands, and smart automations for reminders (day before at 16:00h), new appointment messages, and surgical consent forms (day before surgery).
2.  **AI Persona & Urgency System**: A detailed AI probing guide for patient triage (greeting, pain scale 1-10, historical doctor, specialty-based referral), and a color-coded dashboard system for conversation urgency (Red: urgent, Black: pending, etc.).
3.  **iPhone Widget / PWA**: An iPhone widget for quick voice AI access, which was addressed by implementing a Progressive Web App (PWA) with a dedicated voice assistant interface.
4.  **Bidirectional Google Sheets Sync**: Changes made in the application (e.g., appointment status) must be reflected back in the Google Sheet.
5.  **WhatsApp Integration**: Make WhatsApp operational for AI-driven patient communication, automated reminders, consent forms, and appointment management.
6.  **Gesden/Make.com Workflow Integration**: Integrate an existing workflow where a local Gesden agenda syncs with Google Sheets via a Python script and Make.com, and manage this entire process within the application.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully implemented and thoroughly tested the full WhatsApp Business integration with the application's existing AI capabilities. This included:
1.  **WhatsApp Service**: A new  directory was created containing  with  and  to handle the WhatsApp connection, QR code generation, and message processing. This service runs in the background.
2.  **Backend Integration**:  was updated with new endpoints to interface with the WhatsApp service, enabling the application to send and receive messages, and integrate the AI assistant's logic for automated responses, urgency detection, and specialist referrals. Existing automation systems were also updated to utilize WhatsApp for reminders and consent forms.
3.  **Frontend Management**: A new  component was created. This component provides the UI for connecting to WhatsApp (displaying a QR code), showing the connection status, and offering test message functionality. It was integrated into  as a new WhatsApp IA navigation tab.

Following this, the user introduced an existing external workflow involving a local **Gesden agenda** (SQL Server), a **Python extraction script** run by a scheduled task, **Make.com** for webhooks and updates, and **Google Sheets** for data transfer. An additional Flask API () running locally handles updates back to Gesden via Make.com. The AI engineer has thoroughly analyzed these provided files (, , ) and described the complete bidirectional data flow between Gesden, Make.com, Google Sheets, and the SaaS application. The current state is that this external system has been analyzed, but its integration or management within the primary application is yet to be implemented.
